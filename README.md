# Arutairu - Learn Japanese Vocabulary

Welcome to Arutairu, an open-source Android app designed to help users learn Japanese vocabulary in a fun and efficient way. This app is perfect for anyone interested in improving their Japanese language skills, whether for travel, watching anime, or simply for personal growth.

## About the Project

Passionate about learning languages, and unsatisfied with traditional language learning apps, I developed Arutairu to meet my own needs. As my requirements were met and my time to improve the app diminished, I decided to make Arutairu open-source. This gives the app a fresh new start and the chance to evolve with contributions from the community.

## Features

- **Vocabulary Lists & JLPT Preparation**: Learn Japanese through extensive vocabulary lists and prepare for the JLPT with focused word sets.
- **Pronunciation & Romaji**: Use the Text To Speech service for pronunciation help and read words in Romaji.
- **Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji**: Start with Hiragana, move to Katakana, and finally Kanji as per your comfort level. Vocabulary lists are available in kana and kanji.
- **Offline Access**: Learn anywhere, anytime, without needing an internet connection.
- **Language Support**: Available in both French and English.
- **Hands-Free Mode**: Learn on the go without needing to look at your screen, perfect for use while commuting or exercising.
